# Problem 2

1.  Loaded the data
2.  Crated city_state variable
3.  Removed: Dallax, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City, MO; Tulsa, AL
4.  Filtered so only victim_race = white or black is included
5.  Converted victim_age to numeric type

``` r
homicide_df = read.csv('data/homicide.csv') %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL", city_state != "Dallax, TX", city_state != "Phoneix, AZ", city_state != "Kansas City, MO")
```
