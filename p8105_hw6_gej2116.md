# Problem 2

1.  Loaded the data
2.  Created the following variables:
    -   city_state
    -   case_solved: binary variable where 0 = case unresolved, 1 = case
        resolved
3.  Filtered the data in the following ways:
    -   For city_state, removed Dallax, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City,
        MO; Tulsa, AL
    -   For victim_race, only included White & Black
4.  Converted victim_ageâ€™s data type from char to numeric

``` r
homicide_df = read.csv('data/homicide.csv') %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         case_solved = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "0",
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "0",
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "1")) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL", 
         city_state != "Dallas, TX", 
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", 
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO", 
         victim_race %in% c("White" ,"Black")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```
